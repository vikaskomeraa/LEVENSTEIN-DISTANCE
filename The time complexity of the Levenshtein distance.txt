The time complexity of the Levenshtein distance algorithm implemented in your code can be analyzed as follows:

- Best Case: If the two input strings are identical, meaning there are no insertions, deletions, or substitutions needed, the algorithm will only perform initialization of the distance matrix, which takes O(m * n) time, where m and n are the lengths of the input strings. Therefore, the best-case time complexity is O(m * n), where m and n are the lengths of the input strings.

- Worst Case: In the worst case, the algorithm iterates through each cell of the distance matrix, performing constant time operations for each cell. Therefore, the worst-case time complexity is O(m * n), where m and n are the lengths of the input strings.

- Average Case: The average-case time complexity is also O(m * n), as the algorithm typically involves iterating through each cell of the distance matrix, with the number of iterations being proportional to the product of the lengths of the input strings.

Overall, the time complexity of your Levenshtein distance algorithm is O(m * n), where m and n are the lengths of the input strings.
